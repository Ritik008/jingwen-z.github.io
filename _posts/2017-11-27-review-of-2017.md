Year 2018 comes soon, at the tail of 2017, I would like to review the whole year,
sum up both professional gains and self-learning gains. This year is a turning
point in my life: I finished my study in school and entered the workplace. Thanks
to the rich education of [Toulouse School of Economics][TSE] and the trust of my
lead, I did my modest part to contribute [franprix][franprix] as a Data Scientist.

During this year, I learnt lots of new things in technology, I know how to
communicate with my colleagues and organise time when I have a new project. In
the following, I'll go into detail.

## Technology

### Projects at franprix

In this year, I studied many interesting subjects. In order to find the impact
of weather on sales, I created a linear regression, which can specify the impact
of weather on each subfamily. We found various effects of weather, for instance,
in the top left corner graph, the blue line means the tendency of daily average
precipitation, the orange one presents daily volume of women's umbrella, the
purple one shows daily volume of men's umbrella. We can easily find that the
effect of precipitation on women's umbrella is more than the effect on men's
umbrella. Now, let's see the detail. When precipitation increases 1 mm, 6 more
women's umbrellas will be sold; if it rains, 11 more women's umbrellas will be
sold. However, nearly 3 more men's umbrella can be sold once precipitation
increases 1 mm; only 3 more men's umbrella can be sold if it rains.

In order to help merchandise team to organise the shelves, I used apriori
algorithm analysed consumers' preference, determined the shelves that often sold
together, and found the association between each two shelves. The graph in top
right corner shows some attractive results, like sweet biscuits are associated
with cereals and bars, chocolate confectionery, rusks and chocolates in tablets;
non-alcoholic drinks can bring together with spirits, ships, dry sausages and
salty aperitif; and meats are related with dry sausages and sea caterers.

Moreover, CEO likes to know the sale of franprix-producing juice, baguette and
rotisserie, in terms of hour. For making the report more clear to read, I used
[Microstrategy][Microstrategy] to visualise the data, as the graph in the lower
right corner. From the graph we can observe not only the total sale of 3 shelves
products per hour, but also the detail for each store, which can satisfy
different needs.

Furthermore, we also helped HR Department. As enterprise growing, there are more
and more shops spread all over France, so are its employees. Some employees take
such a long duration for working and going home. To facilitate the way between
one’s home and workplace(shop), CEO proposed that 2 employees can exchange their
workplaces, if it saves time for both. This project is for finding the optimal
solution for all employees. We combined R and Google Maps API, created a tool
for visualising and simplifying the employee-switching. Voilà, like in the lower
left corner graph, we can enter an employee ID and click "choice 1", then his 
domicile and workplace position will display on the map, the best switch for him
as well; it will also display the distance and duration for arriving the new
workplace.

Here I just show you the most insteresing projects of this year, we also achieved
many other projects like automating creation of report and sending e-mail by
[Talend][Talend], visualising data by Microstrategy, analysing stores'
performance, analysing tourist-area stores, etc.

### Self-learning

</p>

As a data scientist, we should never stop learning new things(languages,
technologies, algorithms). In this year, I participated Microstrategy's formation
and learnt how to make a clear and simple visual report with its tools, and
continue to participe online courses. Thanks again to [datacamp][datacamp], I
started to learn basic knowledge of Python. I also learnt linear regression,
ridge regression, lasso and logistic regression in books "Introduction to
Machine Learning with Python" and "Python Machine Learning Cookbook".
