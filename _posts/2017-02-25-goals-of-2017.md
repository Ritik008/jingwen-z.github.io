title: Goals of 2017
---
Year 2017 is the first year in which I start my first full-time job as a data
scientist. Therefore, I want to share with you some goals and expectation about
this year. I try to split the goals into several parts: the goal in my work at
Franprix, the technique of data science, the business analysis, the
communication skill, and the improvement of my language.

## Franprix

Franprix is a dominant grocery store chain of the Groupe Casino, headquartered
in Paris, with over 800 stores and annual turnover of over 1 billion euros. I
joined in the pricing team, my principle mission is to make optimal decision, to
attract more clients and to increase the turnover, with the help of statistical
algorithms and related software. Since I've started working for only two weeks,
currently need to understand, to be familiar with our databases, workflows and
algorithms, and then, contribute to our business.

## Technique

Thanks to working, I get to use some new software.
