As a data scientist, I love sharing what I learnt with writing blogs. In my
portfolio, you will discover the topics that I am engaged in during working and
personal time.

# Analysis

<p align="center">
  <img alt="tag-analysis"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tag-analysis.png"/>
</p>

Data analysis with different visualisations on multiple topics, such as real
estate, climate, COVID-19.
- Airbnb Paris Analysis：Paris is the capital and most populous city of France,
and it also attracts lots of tourists, which makes me eager to dig out Airbnb
locations in Paris. Where are the locations located? What are their prices?
According to the analysis, we find that the majority of Airbnb locations in
Paris are entire home/apartment; most of the locations are location at
Buttes-Montmartre, Popincourt and Vaugirard; the most expensive locations are
located at Elysée, Palais-Bourbon and Louvre. Furthermore, in recent years,
Airbnb locations’ amount increases 102% in Paris, and locations’ average price
does not change that much in general.
- Forest area analysis: Human society and forests influence each other in both
positive and negative ways. Forests provide ecosystem services to humans and
serve as tourist attractions. Forests can also affect people’s health. Human
activities, including harvesting forest resources, can negatively affect forest
ecosystems. Thus, only human protects forest so that forests will supply us
more and more pure air.
- COVID-19 analysis: The outbreak of the COVID-19 has been several months. The
initial outbreak has greatly affected China and other Asian countries. At the
beginning of March, China reached its peak of COVID-19 pandemic for the first
stage. After March, the COVID-19’s proliferation spread to other countries
around the world, especially in Europe and North America. By applying different
visualisation, I did several analysis for different continents, countries and cities.<br>

# API

<p align="center">
  <img alt="tag-api"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tag-api.png"/>
</p>

Presenting how to extract data with different APIs.
- Distance: For the real distance between two locations, I usually use the
Google Distance Matrix API, which is a service that provides travel distance and
time for a matrix of origins and destinations, based on the recommended route
between start and end points.
- Place's reviews: Imagine that you have a friend who recommend a restaurant to
you, how will you check its location and know if it’s really good? Maybe Google
Maps is a good choice, since you can get its note and reviews given by clients.
In my blog, I talked about how to get the note and reviews for a batch of
address by Google Place API.<br>

# CI

<p align="center">
  <img alt="tag-ci"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tag-ci.png"/>
</p>

My blog specifies how to automate python scripts to run by GitLab CI. I talked
about each element of the configuration with “.gitlab-ci.yml”, manage
environments with anaconda and “environment.yml”, and settings on GitLab.<br>

# Excel

<p align="center">
  <img alt="tag-excel"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tag-excel.jpg"/>
</p>

My blog introduces how to use `openpyxl` package to manipulate Microsoft Excel
workbook and worksheet, like create a workbook and worksheet, write values in
cells, set font(size, type, bold, italic), cut and paste values from one cell
to another, remove one row, merge cells, set number format, set cells'
background colors and center text in one cell, wrap text in one cell, reset
columns' width, set borders, hide grid, reset zoom scale, create named range
and save the workbook.<br>

## Geovisualisation

<p align="center">
  <img alt="tag-geovisualisation"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tag-geovisualisation.png"/>
</p>

Geovisualisation created by `folium` module of python. In my blogs:
- I talked about how to draw a variety of maps with `folium` module in Python,
such as displaying all locations with points / clusters, painting areas with
different colors, adding labels on the map, adding polygon borders, etc.
- I applied geovisualisation on different topics like real estate, climate
change and COVID-19.<br>

# Machine learning

<p align="center">
  <img alt="tag-machine-learning"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tag-machine-learning.png"/>
</p>

Reviews and projects of Machine Learning models / algorithms, such as:
- Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines
- Gradient Descent algorithm,
- etc.<br>

# SQL

<p align="center">
  <img alt="tag-sql"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tag-sql.png"/>
</p>

Various manipulation with SQL query, such as:
- ISO calendar: When we create yearly, monthly or weekly report, we are
sometimes beset by problem about calendar. Like the last day of year 2018
(2018-12-31) is regarded as one day of 2018 or 2019 ? Or the last day of year
2018 is considered as one day of 2018’s last week or 2019’s first week? It’s a
question about ISO calendar, and the answer depends on what we want. In my blog,
I talked about how to handle ISO calendar with Teradata Database SQL.
- Data processing: we can take advantage of SQL query to improve `pandas`
dataframe processing performance.<br>

# Visualisation

<p align="center">
  <img alt="tag-visualisation"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tag-analysis.png"/>
</p>

Visualisation created by multiple modules of python or R. In my blogs:
- I talked about how to create various plots with `matplotlib` module of python,
such as scatter plot, treemap, venn diagram, area chart, radar chart, etc.
- I explained how to read and understand box plot.
- I applied multiple visualisations on different analytics topics, like climate
change, real estate, COVID-19, etc.<br>
