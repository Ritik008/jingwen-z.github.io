In statistics, the logistic model (or logit model) is used to model the
probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose,
alive/dead or healthy/sick. This can be extended to model several classes of
events such as determining whether an image contains a cat, dog, lion, etc. Each
object being detected in the image would be assigned a probability between 0 and
1 and the sum adding to one.
